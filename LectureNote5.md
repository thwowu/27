### Lecture Note

#### Compression techniques
#### windows techniques
- ex: 15 mins (then consider the next window in the period of 15 mins)
- challenge: finding the right bandwidth of the window length. 

Text Mining:
- delete the stops words to extract information from the data

Solution to too much information
- Thread: parallel computing
- Volatile solution: delete after use

DSMS solution 
- DB(relation, multimedia, graphs) <- keep the memory largest as possible
- simplification: not storing all the tweets but only partially
- filtering: not storing all the tweets
- data replacement
⋅⋅* data deleted after a period of time (delete the past)
⋅⋅* only store the latest period of data

Time Frame Segmentation: (related to window techniques)

# Lecture Note

1. Compression techniques
2. windows techniques

⋅⋅* ex: 15 mins (then consider the next window in the period of 15 mins)

3. challenge: finding the right bandwidth of the window length. 

Text Mining:
- delete the stops words to extract information from the data

Solution to too much information
- Thread: parallel computing
- Volatile solution: delete after use

DSMS solution 
- DB(relation, multimedia, graphs) <- keep the memory largest as possible
- simplification: not storing all the tweets but only partially
- filtering: not storing all the tweets
- data replacement
⋅⋅* data deleted after a period of time (delete the past)
⋅⋅* only store the latest period of data

Time Frame Segmentation: (related to window techniques)


## Graph model for social network

- Nodes: individual actors within the network
⋅⋅* Nodes with label: user names

- Ties: relationships betweens the actors
⋅⋅* Edges: not labelled
⋅⋅* directional: (path)  predecessors $(father)$, successor
- links may have attributes, directed or undirected
- Network Type
⋅⋅* Homogeneous network: only one type of relationship (like friendship) 
⋅⋅* Geterogeneous network: (follower relationship "bold line" + similarity relationship "dot line" )
